            <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
            <p>Dear Eileen, </p>
            <p>Thank you for your recent application to join as at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part <br>
            of your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
            <h2>Starting dates</h2>
            <p>We are happy to acccomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you <br>
            could stard at the begininning of a semester; the start dates for each are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>First semester: <time dateline="2016-09-09">9 September 2016</li>
                <li>First semester: <time dateline="2017-01-15">15 January 2017</li>
                <li>First semester: <time dateline="2017-05-02">2 May 2017</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
            <p>you can find more information about <a href="https://www.totalitarismo.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/gigachadgun-960x1125.jpg">important university dates</a> on our website</p>
            <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
            <p>
                As the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects fall <br>
                somewhere in the realm of science  and technology. You see like an intelligen, dedicated researcher, and just <br>
                the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, one of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued <br>
                by are as follows, in order of priority:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>
                    H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C(86°F),when the <br>
                    audience size exoponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect <br>
            the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
            </p>
            <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
            <p>
                Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, <br>
                my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
                    <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around <br>
                        in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".
                    </dd>
                <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
                    <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which <br>
                        involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly <br>
                        tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired <br>
                        modern styles such as Twerking.
                    </dd>
                <dt>Artic robot dance</dt>
                    <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have <br>
                        discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants <br>
                        of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this <br>
                        because they were really cold.
                    </dd>
            </dl>
            <p>For more of my research, see my <a href="https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.2950581090.0152/st,small,507x507-pad,600x600,f8f8f8.jpg">exotic dance research page.</a></p>
