    <h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

    <p>
      This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been
      adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the
      years.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern
      dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
      <li>175g of tahini</li>
      <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
      <li>Half a red pepper</li>
      <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
      <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
      <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
      <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
      <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste</li>
      <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
      <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      For a different flavor, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon
      and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or
      spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.
    </p>

    <h2>Storage</h2>

    <p>
      Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able
      to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become
      fizzy, you should definitely discard it.
    </p>

    <h5>
      Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a
      couple of months.
    </h5>
